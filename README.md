Hi my name is Romain, I moved to the UK a few months ago and I've been loving it so far. Don't get me wrong, water does taste like rat out here, and I've seen more people getting arrested in my first two weeks here than I've ever seen in my life.
I love Graphic design and I'd love to learn more about coding and computation stuff, I'm kinda know about basic graphic design but it doesn't get u far these dys yk?
Music wise I love Y2K classics. ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶
A fun fact about me is that I've watched the entire serie of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, didn't miss a single episode.
